## How to Play
Launch the game by following the installation instructions.
Enter the names of the two players.
The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X', and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.
The game board will be displayed on the screen.
Players take turns placing their symbols on the empty cells of the board by clicking on them.
The first player to align their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If all cells on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
Enjoy and have fun!
